## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please use https://g.co/vulnz to report security vulnerabilities.

We use https://g.co/vulnz for our intake and triage. For valid issues we will do coordination and disclosure here on
GitHub (including using a GitHub Security Advisory when necessary).

The Google Security Team will process your report within a day, and respond within a week (although it will depend on the severity of your report).
